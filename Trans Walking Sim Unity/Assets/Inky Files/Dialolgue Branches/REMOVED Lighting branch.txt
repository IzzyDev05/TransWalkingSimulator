Oh yes, I finally had the oppurtunity to set the lights to my liking today! Do you like them?
* [Yes, I think they look really pretty!] -> PrettyLights
* [Umm, no. Not really if I'm being honest.] -> DontLikeTheLights

== PrettyLights ==
Thank you so much! What do you like about them?
* [It gives a really good vibe!] -> BackToIntro
* [The colour scheme is just so darn good!] -> BackToIntro
* [No particular reason, they just look really good!] -> BackToIntro

== BackToIntro ==
Well, thank you very much! It really means a lot to me that you like them!
* [Haha no problem]
So what brings you here today?
-> InitialChoices

== DontLikeTheLights ==
Oh I see. Why might that be?
* [I'm not really a fan of neon kinda lights to be honest, but they aren't ugly or anything] -> IndifferentLights
* [Ehh, just becasuse] -> BadEnd

== IndifferentLights ==
Oh okay. Well, thank you, I guess.
* [Yeah...]
So, anything that brings you here other than the lights?
-> InitialChoices

== BadEnd ==
Well, thank you for your input. I was about to close the cafe. The door's right there! Thanks for coming in!
* [Ohh uhh, yeah. Gnight.] -> END
